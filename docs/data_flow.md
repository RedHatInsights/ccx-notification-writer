# Data flow

The "end-to-end" data flow is described there (including Notification Writer service part):

1. A customer cluster with *Insights Operator* installed sends new data containing info about the cluster into *Ingress service*
1. The *Ingress service* consumes the data, writes them into an S3 Bucket, and produces a new message into a Kafka topic named `platform.upload.announce`.
1. The *CCX Data pipeline* service consumes the message from the `platform.upload.announce` Kafka topic.
1. That message represents an event that contains (among other things) an URL to S3 Bucket.
1. Insights operator data is read from S3 Bucket and *insights rules* are applied to that data in `ccx-data-pipeline` service.
1. Results (basically `organization ID` + `cluster name` + `insights results JSON`) are stored back into Kafka, but into different topic named `ccx.ocp.results`.
1. That results are consumed by `ccx-notification-writer` service.
1. `ccx-notification-writer` service stores insights results into AWS RDS database into `new_reports` table.
1. Content of that table is consumed by `ccx-notification-service` periodically.
1. Newest results from `new_reports` table is compared with results stored in `reported` table.
1. If changes (new issues) has been found, notification message is sent into Kafka topic named `platform.notifications.ingress`.
1. The newest result is stored into `reported` table to be used in the next `ccx-notification-service` iteration.

### Remarks

1. Steps 1 to  5 are shared with the CCX Data pipeline
1. Steps 7 and 8 are performed by `ccx-notification-writer` service.
1. Steps 9 to 12 are performed by `ccx-notification-service` service.
