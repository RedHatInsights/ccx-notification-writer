## Description

The main task for this service is to listen to configured Kafka topic, consume
all messages from such topic, and write OCP results (in JSON format) with
additional information (like organization ID, cluster name, Kafka offset etc.)
into a database table named `new_reports`. Multiple reports can be consumed and
written into the database for the same cluster, because the primary (compound)
key for `new_reports` table is set to the combination `(org_id, cluster,
updated_at)`. When some message does not conform to expected schema (for
example if `org_id` is missing for any reason), such message is dropped and the
error message with all relevant information about the issue is stored into the
log. Messages are expected to contain `report` body represented as JSON.
This body is shrunk before it's stored into database so the database
remains relatively small.

Additionally this service exposes several metrics about consumed and processed
messages. These metrics can be aggregated by Prometheus and displayed by
Grafana tools.

```

### Starting the service

In order to start the service, just `./ccx-notification-writer` is needed to be called from CLI.

### Cleanup old records

It is possible to cleanup old records from `new_reports` and `reported` tables. To do it, use the following CLI options:

```
./ccx-notification-writer -old-reports-cleanup --max-age="30 days"
```

to perform cleanup of `reported` table.

It is also possible to use following command

```
./ccx-notification-writer -new-reports-cleanup --max-age="30 days"
```

to perform cleanup of `new_reports` table.

Additionally it is possible to just display old reports without touching the database tables:

```
./ccx-notification-writer -print-old-reports-for-cleanup --max-age="30 days"
```

or in case of new reports:

```
./ccx-notification-writer -print-new-reports-for-cleanup --max-age="30 days"
```


## Metrics

It is possible to use `/metrics` REST API endpoint to read all metrics
exposed to Prometheus or to any tool that is compatible with it. Currently,
the following metrics are exposed:

### Exposed metrics

* `notification_writer_check_last_checked_timestamp`
    - The total number of messages with last checked timestamp
* `notification_writer_check_schema_version`
    - The total number of messages with successful schema check
* `notification_writer_consumed_messages`
    - The total number of messages consumed from Kafka
* `notification_writer_consuming_errors`
    - The total number of errors during consuming messages from Kafka
* `notification_writer_marshal_report`
    - The total number of marshaled reports
* `notification_writer_parse_incoming_message`
    - The total number of parsed messages
* `notification_writer_shrink_report`
    - The total number of shrunk reports
* `notification_writer_stored_messages`
    - The total number of messages stored into database
* `notification_writer_stored_bytes`
    - The total number of bytes stored into database

### Retriewing metrics

For service running locally:

```
curl localhost:8080/metrics | grep ^notification_writer
```

## Database

PostgreSQL database is used as a storage for new reports and for already reported reports as well.

### Migrations

This service contains an implementation of a simple database migration
mechanism that allows semi-automatic transitions between various database
versions as well as building the latest version of the database from scratch.

Migration mechanism [is described here](https://redhatinsights.github.io/ccx-notification-writer/migrations.html)

### Database schema

Latest database schema is described [in this document](https://redhatinsights.github.io/ccx-notification-writer/database.html)
